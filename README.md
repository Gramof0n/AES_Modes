# AES_Modes
Implementation of ECB, CBC, CTR and CCM encryption modes of AES

The implementation was done as a part of university course "Data security (Cryptography)"

For the Rijndael algorithm (which is the AES itself) the library from bouncycastle was used.

In order to run the encrytor/decryptor, clone the repository and run the .jar file.
